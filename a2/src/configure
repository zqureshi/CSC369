    --debug              Compile the user-level programs with debug info.
                         This is disabled by default because there's no
                         support for userlevel source debugging in OS/161.
                         (Note: debug info in the kernel is controlled by
                         the kernel config file.)

    --werror             Compile with -Werror, so that compiler warnings 
                         are turned into errors and cause the build to
			 stop. Recommended, because on long builds you 
                         don't always notice warnings as they go by, but
                         disabled by default.

    --ostree=PATH        Install the compiled system in a directory tree
                         rooted at PATH. Default is \$HOME/cs161/root.

    --toolprefix=NAME    Set up to use compiler and tools named with a
                         prefix of NAME. The default is "cs161-", so the
                         tools used are called cs161-gcc, cs161-ld, etc.
                         The directory with these tools should be on your
                         shell's search path.

    # Long explanatory comment about the two sets of compiler tools.
    cat <<EOF
#
# Because OS/161 runs on one architecture (probably MIPS or ANT32) and
# is compiled on another (probably Alpha or i386) it is important to
# make sure the right compiler (and assembler, linker, etc.) is used
# at every point.
#
# A compiler compiles *running on* one platform, and *generates code*
# that may run on a different platform. Thus, supposing that you are 
# building MIPS OS/161 on i386 Linux, there are four possible compilers.
# (If you are building some other OS/161 or building on some other
# platform, make the appropriate substitutions.) These four are:
#
#    (1) runs on i386 Linux, generates code for i386 Linux
#    (2) runs on i386 Linux, generates code for MIPS OS/161
#    (3) runs on MIPS OS/161, generates code for i386 Linux
#    (4) runs on MIPS OS/161, generates code for MIPS OS/161
#
# Note that when building on i386 Linux, there is no use for a
# compiler that runs on MIPS OS/161; you can't run it. Thus cases
# (3) and (4) do not interest us.
#
# However, in the course of the build, there are places where it is
# necessary to compile and run programs on the machine the build is
# happening on. Thus, the makefiles need to be able to access *both*
# compiler (1) and compiler (2).
#
# We do this by defining the make variable CC to be the common case,
# compiler (2), and the make variable HOST_CC to be compiler (1). 
# Similar variables are defined for the other bits of the toolchain,
# like AS (assembler), LD (linker), and SIZE (size program).
#
# Then, programs to be run during the build can be compiled with 
# HOST_CC, and components of the system can be built with CC.
